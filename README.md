# empty-standby-list
This is used to release working sets, if u have a memory leak and dont want to restart ur computer or just want to release the sets this is a great solution

#### 1. **Download the tool**
Go to:
- Extract the `.zip` file
- Place `EmptyStandbyList.exe` in this path:  
  `C:\MemoryTools\EmptyStandbyList.exe`

---
#### 2. **Run the script as Administrator**
- Right-click your `.bat` file
- Click **Run as administrator**

---

Let me know if you want an **invisible version** that runs silently in the background with no window.
